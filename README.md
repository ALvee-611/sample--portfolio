# Data Science Portfolio
This repository contains some of my data science and data analysis projects completed for as part of my academic and self learning journey. 

## Contents
- ### Power BI Dashboard
	- [End-to-End Business Intelligence Dashboard](https://github.com/ALvee-611/Project-Samples/tree/main/Dashboards/AdventureWorks): connected to different data sources, built complex relational data models, added calculated fields and measures using DAX and designed an interactive dashboard from scratch to highlight jey insights and KPI
	
- ### R

	- [Exploratory data analysis using R](https://www.kaggle.com/alveejawadchowdhury/exploratory-analysis-using-r/notebook): Explored how funding changed over the 3 years period and performed Topic Modelling on the organization's description to see if there were any common themes
	- [regression analysis of the 1976 Panel Study of Income Dynamics](https://github.com/ALvee-611/Project-Samples/blob/main/Data%20Science/Project.pdf): Identified useful features using significance tests. Performed data modelling and inference with multiple restrictions and conducted hypothesis testing and prediction.
	- [AFM 423](https://github.com/ALvee-611/AFM-423): One of my undergrad courses which focused in developing econometric/statistical methods to study financial market data, and in quantitatively assessing risks associated with financial investments.

- ### Python

	- [Predicting players' ratings based on Woogles.io (Scrabble) gameplay](https://github.com/ALvee-611/Scrabble-Player-Rating): Used various statistical supervised models like Rnadom Forest Regressor and XGBoost to try predicting the ratings of a player based on their gameplay. This work is still in progress as I continue to try improve on my current work to get a better result. [Currently ranked 21 out of 204](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/scrabble-player-rating/leaderboard#)
	- [Image Classifier: Mask or No Mask?](https://github.com/ALvee-611/Project-Samples/blob/main/Data%20Science/image_classifier.ipynb): Designed a simple image classifier that can detect if the person in the image is wearing a mask or not. The data for this project was collected by scraping Google images using a browser extension. 

- ### SQL

	- [SQL](https://github.com/ALvee-611/Project-Samples/tree/main/SQL):  included two recent sql script where I wrote where I performed analysis and data cleaning using sql.

- ### Writing Sample

	- [Writing Sample 1](https://github.com/ALvee-611/Project-Samples/blob/main/Writing%20sample/Final%20Report.pdf):  my final project for the ENGL 378 course. ENGL 378 focuses on oral and written communication in the fields of statistics and actuarial science with emphasis on the public presentation of technical knowledge, the ability to give and receive constructive feedback, and communication in a collaborative environment
	- [Writing Sample 2: Blog](https://alveej611.wixsite.com/my-site-1/post/using-a-naive-approach-to-solve-complex-problems) Wrote a Blog explaing Bayes theorem in layman terms. Published the blog in Wix and was part of my coursework for ENGL 378


I recently started investing more time in Kaggle and currently working on two projects:
- [OTTO – Multi-Objective Recommender System](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system)
- [Scrabble Player Rating](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/scrabble-player-rating)
